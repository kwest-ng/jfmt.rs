# `jfmt` - JSON Auto-Formatter

Ever needed a simple JSON formatter in a command-line tool?  No?!  Oh. ...Well
then this isn't going to help you.  Bye, I guess.  Oh, wait, have you seen my
jacket?  It's the one I wore to that really casual wedding we went to.  What?
What do you mean you weren't there?  You were totally there.  You bought me
a drink once it switched to a cash bar.  Oh shut up, you've defenitely been to
a cash bar before.  Wait.....  It was Jamar that bought me the drink, because I
helped him move into his condo.  So why did he tell me it was you?  And where
the hell is my jacket?!

# Quickstart

```bash
cargo install jfmt
```
